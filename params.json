  "body": "### Introduction\r\nTrump Speech Editor is a javascript project that allows you to mute sections of a youtube video. \r\n\r\n[Click here to Start](http://marciojmo.github.io/trump-speech-editor/editor.html).\r\n\r\n[Click here to see a working example](https://marciojmo.github.io/trump-speech-editor/view.html?v=tLSy8Tl2bjs&i=34,56;73,82;).\r\n\r\nI've created this project because of this tweet:\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Someone should try editing a video of Trump speaking and removing the sound whenever he's saying something false.</p>â€” Paul Graham (<a href=\"https://github.com/paulg\" class=\"user-mention\">@paulg</a>) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/764879003513651200\">August 14, 2016</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nPaul is one of my top influencers.\r\n\r\n### The Editor\r\nThe editor allows you to select sections of a YouTube video and generate a URL to visualize the video with the selected sections silenced.\r\n\r\n### The Viewer\r\nThe viewer is responsible for playing the video and for controling the video's volume. It receives a video_id and a list of non overlaping, ordered, time intervals to mute. </p>\r\n\r\n### Know Bugs\r\n- The editor is not checking if the id provided by the user is a valid Youtube video id.\r\n- The player is not handling when the user moves the video forward or rewind it.\r\n- If the list of intervals to mute is unordered or overlaped the viewer may not work.\r\n\r\n### Support & Contributions\r\n- Handle forward/rewind.\r\n- Integrate with a URL shortener.\r\n- Integrate with a speech recognition system and train a Neural Network to auto-mute Trump's sophist sentences. hahaha",
